<h2>Pioneerof the Nile 5/5/06 - 3/18/19 </h2>

<p>
    The passing of the great Pioneerof the Nile has left many of us shaken after what has already been an emotionally wrenching few months for any horse-racing fan.  His sudden death at age 13 gives us all another hard reminder that these animals are not put here forever, that the gifts they give to us will one day end, and usually far before we're ready.  
</p>
<p>
    I am so vey sad I'll never have the chance to visit him now.  His personality, like his legendary son, American Pharoah, was his most wonderous quality.  A Thoroughbred stallion, and a top one at that, with a loving and kind personality is not something all that common, and it must have been such a treat for so many who went to visit him to get in such proximity to a racing icon.
</p>
<p>
    It feels extra unfair that the sires of both our living Triple Crown winners now have each passed away well before we ever found out their true potential.  American Pharoah was only Pioneerof the Nile's second foal crop, and Classic Empire was out of just his fourth.  What else may have come down the road?  This is truly a tragedy for the American Thoroughbred industry, one we unfortunetely have to bear as a reality all too often.
